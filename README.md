This project contains a Python script named log_analyzer.py which is designed to analyze web server log data. The script is particularly useful for understanding user behavior by analyzing access logs typically generated by web servers. It extracts and processes data such as IP addresses, timestamps, HTTP methods, endpoints accessed, and user agents.

The core purpose of this script is to answer three specific questions from the log data:

First, it identifies how many requests were made within 10 seconds after the first request from each unique IP address. This helps to determine user engagement and the frequency of access in a short time window.

Second, it counts how many requests were made by each User-Agent string. This provides insight into which browsers, tools, or bots are most commonly used to access the server.

Third, it calculates how many times each endpoint on the server was accessed. This is useful for understanding which parts of a website or application are most frequently visited.

To use the script, the user must paste their log entries into the log_data variable located inside the Python file. The log data must be in a specific format that includes the date, time, IP address, HTTP method, requested endpoint, and User-Agent string. If the format of your log data differs from this, the regular expression used in the script may need to be adjusted accordingly.

The script should be run using Python version 3.6 or higher. It can be executed directly from a terminal or command line interface. Once the script is executed, it will parse the log entries and display the results for each of the three questions in a structured format.

This tool is intended for software developers, server administrators, data analysts, or anyone interested in understanding how a web server is being accessed. It is simple, lightweight, and can be customized to fit more advanced use cases. The script is free to use, modify, and distribute.
